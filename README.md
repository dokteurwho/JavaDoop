#ShavaDoop

__ShavaDoop__  count words in a file with distributed computers in a slower manner than with only one computer.

The delivery consists in two JAR files:

1. Master.JAR

2. Slave.JAR

Master will orchestrate many Slave instances to map then reduce every word of the file as presented below.

* https://github.com/dokteurwho/JavaDoop/blob/master/ShavaDoop.md details the full framework usage and gives some implementation details.

* https://github.com/dokteurwho/JavaDoop/blob/master/Example.md provides some command line samples to dive directly into the Shavadoop.

* https://github.com/dokteurwho/JavaDoop/blob/master/CodeTravail.log is an exeuction log sample. Top and bottom of the file are relevant.

* ALombre.txt is a book you can use to make some tests. It is intersting to cross it with specific stop words to identify pattern in Proust literary work.

* Download stop words here: http://snowball.tartarus.org/algorithms/french/stop.txt. The file can be directly use and improved / adapted if needed.
